# Lighting Design for Final-Year Study Room Project

This repository contains the resources for the lighting design project for the final-year study room located on the ground floor of the **Sumanadasa Building**, completed as part of the **EE4410: Electrical Services for Buildings** course (Assignment 1).

## üìå Project Overview

The objective of this project is to develop an **energy-efficient lighting system** that adheres to the illumination standards set by **CIBSE** and **IESNA**, creating a comfortable and productive study environment. The lighting design:

- Achieves an illuminance level of **300‚Äì500 lux**
- Minimizes glare and eye strain
- Ensures optimal **energy efficiency**
- Is validated using both **DialuxEvo simulations** and **manual point-by-point calculations**
