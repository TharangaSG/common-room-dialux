Lighting Design for Final-Year Study Room
Project Overview
This repository contains the resources for the lighting design project for the final-year study room located on the ground floor of the Sumanadasa Building, as part of the EE4410 Electrical Services for Buildings course (Assignment 1). The project focuses on developing an energy-efficient lighting system that meets the illumination standards set by CIBSE and IESNA, ensuring a comfortable and productive study environment.
The design achieves an illuminance level of 300â€“500 lux, minimizes glare, reduces eye strain, and optimizes energy efficiency. The lighting layout was modeled and analyzed using DialuxEvo software, with manual point-by-point calculations performed to validate the results.
